        <h1>What is Investing?</h1>
    </header>

        <p>Investing is the act of putting money into something with the expectation of getting a return. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets.
        <br><br>
        There are many reasons why people invest. Some people invest to save for retirement, while others invest to grow their wealth. Still others invest to generate income.
        <br><br>
        <b>How to Invest:</b>
        <br>
        There are many different ways to invest. Some of the most common methods include:
        <br><br>
        <b>Stocks:</b> 
        <br>
        Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you buy stocks, you are essentially buying a piece of the company. Stocks can be a good way to grow your wealth over time, but they can also be volatile.
        <br><br>
        <b>Bonds:</b> 
        <br>
        Bonds are loans that you make to a company or government. When you buy a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer. Bonds are generally less volatile than stocks, but they also offer lower returns.
        <br><br>
        <b>Real estate:</b> 
        <br>Real estate is another popular investment option. When you buy real estate, you are essentially buying a piece of property. Real estate can be a good way to generate income, but it can also be illiquid.
        <br><br>
        <b>Other assets:</b> 
        <br>There are many other assets that you can invest in, such as commodities, currencies, and derivatives. These assets can be more complex than stocks, bonds, and real estate, so they are not suitable for everyone.
        <br><br>
